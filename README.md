## Setup Instructions

You will need [Godot Mono]() `v3.0.6` which can be downloaded from the [Godot
Downloads Page](https://godotengine.org/download). The Mono version of Godot is
required in order to support [C#
Scripting](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html)
in Godot. 

You will also need to install Mono version `v5.12.0` or above which can be
downloaded from the [Mono Downloads
Page](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/). Please pick the correct
corresponding 64bit or 32bit so that Godot and Mono match.

In order to edit the C# scripts [you will want a C# development IDE](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#configuring-an-external-editor).
VisualStudioCode and MonoDevelop are the two best supported options currently,
although it's likely that other IDE's will work too.

## Notes/Discussion

C# is listed as an alpha feature in Godot, not recommended for production. It appears to be fairly well documented in their documentation, I got it working easily for a hello world example, and bugs are getting fixed quickly, but do we want to take the risk of using it? Or do we want to use GDScript (What I used previously with Godot, similar to python and easy to learn), or do we want to switch to Unity?

It might be good if the group has a play with the C# script and maybe a GDScript hello world example too [Godot Scripting Tutorial](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting.html) and [Godot C# Introduction](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html) so we can make up our about what to use.
